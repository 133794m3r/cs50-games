Each assignment's folder has a readme with the video URL, and also what features they contain.

# Lua/Love2D

## Pong
Has the pong game thingy. It has a super basic AI that plays against you.

## Fiftybird
A flappy bird clone.

## Breakout
A breakout clone.

## Match3
Bejewelled/other match3 clone.

## Mario
A side-scrolling platformer.

## Zelda
 Action RPG with pots that are throwable.

## Pokemon
Recreating of pokemon. All I added was the levelup information.


# Unity Assignments
Since they're much larger I only am including what's changed. Also you have to download the super out of date versioin of unity to first import and upgrade it to a later version so that you can use it.

## LameHeli
I didn't include the entire asset tree only the scripts.

## DreadHalls
Same here except I also included the scenes. the files are too large otherwise.

## Portal Problems
Since this is literally creating a level I can't very easily not include the whole repo.


# Capstone
The capstone project is in it's own repo.

Originally I was making an RPG but decided I didn't want to spend the time on it due to how much work would be required.
